# immi-crm-vue
Git repository for my custom app dev project.


Technology used : 

All that a web application requires during production is web hosting and domain name.
Hosting will provide storage space and computational power to let users access our app.
Buying hosting space and domain name from a third party hosting service is sufficient for most applications on the web.


Platform details : 

A web app consists of mainly four parts.
1. Front end : The UI and client side logic comes here. We are using a MVC based framework “Vue.js” that provides a component based development process.

2. Backend: the server side logic and functionality of the application comes here. We are using the “Express” and “NodeJS” framework to implement the backend.

3. Database Management : We will be using one or more of the following - 
       - MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL,
       - Sequelize, ORMs



Functionality of our web app : 

Landing page - welcome section. Unauthorised users can only access the landing page and no further. 

Login and Register - to only allow authorised access. Upon successful login or registration, user will be routed to the dashboard.

Dashboard / Home - contain snapshots of all the functionality of the app, serving data accurately to the users.


Main features will include : 

Section 1 - Applications Management - where users can view, sort, filter, and make actions on an application or group of applications.
   - Notes made by both the applicant and the attorney will be here for viewing

Section 2 - Schedule Management - where users can create, update and view their schedules and meetings.
    - Past Meetings
    - Upcoming Meetings.

Section 3 - Messaging - recording and viewing conversations between the user and their clients.

Section 4 - History/ Activity - log of all the activity and workflow between a user and client.

More features will be added with time.
